To run the Federated Drug Trial Eligibility Screener, you need to open three separate terminal windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run the following commands.

Note: Make sure you have the generated `.env` files in both the root folder and the `frontend` folder for the database connections and API URLs to work properly.
